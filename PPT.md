# SmartPredict: Smartphone Purchase Prediction
## PowerPoint Presentation Content

---

## 1. Introduction

### 📱 **Project Overview**
- **Problem Statement**: Smartphone companies struggle to identify which customers are likely to make purchases, leading to inefficient marketing spending and missed opportunities
- **Solution Approach**: Develop an AI-powered prediction system using machine learning to analyze customer demographics, behavior patterns, and preferences
- **Project Impact**: Enable data-driven marketing decisions, improve customer targeting accuracy, and provide real-time insights through an interactive web dashboard

---

## 2. Objective

### 🎯 **Primary Goals**
- **Predict Purchase Intent**: Build a machine learning model to predict whether a customer will purchase a smartphone based on demographics and behavior
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Create a user-friendly web dashboard for real-time predictions and data visualization
- **Business Intelligence**: Provide actionable insights for marketing teams to target high-probability customers

---

## 3. Methodology - Data and Preprocessing

### 📊 **Data Strategy**
- **Dataset Size**: 10,000+ records with 18 features including age, income, brand preference, and usage patterns
- **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, outlier detection, and standardize column formats for consistent processing
- **Feature Engineering**: Create derived features, one-hot encode categorical variables (brands), and apply StandardScaler normalization

---

## 4. Methodology - Model and Dashboard

### 🤖 **ML Implementation**
- **Algorithm Choice**: Random Forest Classifier for high accuracy and feature importance interpretation
- **Model Pipeline**: Preprocessing → Feature scaling → Model training → Validation with 10-fold cross-validation
- **Dashboard Architecture**: Flask REST API backend with HTML/CSS/JS frontend using Chart.js for interactive visualizations

---

## 5. Accuracy Comparison Across Different Models

### 📈 **Model Performance**
- **Random Forest**: 87.3% accuracy (chosen model) - Best balance of accuracy and interpretability
- **Logistic Regression**: 82.1% accuracy - Good baseline but lower performance on complex patterns
- **XGBoost**: 86.8% accuracy - Strong performance but less interpretable than Random Forest

---

## 6. Conclusion

### ✅ **Key Achievements**
- **High Accuracy**: Achieved 87.3% prediction accuracy with excellent precision (85.1%) and recall (89.7%)
- **Practical Application**: Successfully deployed interactive dashboard with real-time predictions and brand comparison

## 8. Deployment (Azure App Service)

### ☁️ Summary
- Linux App Service with Oryx build from `requirements.txt`
- `Procfile` runs Gunicorn: `web: gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT app:app`
- Entry point: root `app.py` (exports `app`)

### CLI Flow (high level)
1. `az login` and select subscription
2. `az group create -n <rg> -l <region>`
3. `az webapp up -n <app-name> -g <rg> -l <region> --runtime "PYTHON|3.11"`
4. `az webapp log tail -n <app-name> -g <rg>` for live logs

### Slide Tips
- Include an architecture box: User → App Service → Flask (Gunicorn) → Model/Files
- Add troubleshooting callouts (wheels for Python 3.13, port binding)

## 9. UI/UX Enhancements

### 🎨 Highlights
- Colorful, tasteful scrollbars and input carets (fallbacks for Firefox)
- Subtle gradient cursor trail (desktop only; reduces motion when requested)
- Improved contrast and spacing for readability; mobile-friendly meta tags

### Show & Tell
- Before/after screenshots
- Short GIF of cursor trail and theme

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes

- Discriminatory or derogatory comments or imagery
- Harassing or stalking behavior
- Public or private harassment including insults or shaming
- Posting sexual content or language in a non-consensual context

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing this code of conduct. Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, pull requests, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, and to temporarily or permanently ban any member of the community for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Reporting Guidance

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please report it by contacting the project maintainers at:

- Email: mandar@example.com
- Or open a private GitHub Security advisory / contact the repository owner on GitHub

All reports will be handled with discretion and with respect for the privacy of all parties involved.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at the email address above. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community.
